# Solution of the second task

## Description
Use your preferred test automation tool to automate test case: Go to your favorite e-shop, navigate to some category and add two most expensive items to the shopping cart from this category. Provide code from implementation.

## Solution
Implementation in Squish Froglogic (https://www.froglogic.com/tag/squish-ide/)automation framework. I automate by it in work.\
\
There are two files:
  * suite_eshop_example\tst_buy2items\test -> it contains implementation of the test
  * suite_eshop_example\shared\scripts\names.py -> it contains web locators of web elements objects
  
 ## Run the suite case
 You can only open this "suite_eshop_example" on Squish IDE and click on the green play button
